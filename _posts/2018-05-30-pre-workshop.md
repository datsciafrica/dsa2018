# Configure a DSA Environment with [Anaconda](http://conda.pydata.org/docs)


> Conda is an open source package management system and environment management system
for installing multiple versions of software packages and their dependencies and
switching easily between them. It works on Linux, OS X and Windows, and was created
for Python programs but can package and distribute any software.

## Overview
Using Anaconda consists of the following:

1. Install [`miniconda`](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) on your computer
2. Create a new `conda` [environment](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html) using this project
3. Each time you wish to work, activate your `conda` environment

---

## Installation

**Download** the latest version of `miniconda` that matches your system.

|        | Linux | Mac | Windows |
|--------|-------|-----|---------|
| 64-bit | [64-bit (bash installer)][lin64] | [64-bit (bash installer)][mac64] | [64-bit (exe installer)][win64]
| 32-bit | [32-bit (bash installer)][lin32] |  | [32-bit (exe installer)][win32]

[win64]: https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe
[win32]: https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86.exe
[mac64]: https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
[lin64]: https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
[lin32]: https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86.sh

**Install** [miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) on your machine. Detailed instructions:

- **Linux:** http://conda.pydata.org/docs/install/quick.html#linux-miniconda-install
- **Mac:** http://conda.pydata.org/docs/install/quick.html#os-x-miniconda-install
- **Windows:** http://conda.pydata.org/docs/install/quick.html#windows-miniconda-install

**Setup** the `dsa2018` environment.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/emwebaze/dsa2018materials.git
cd setup
```

**Create** dsa2018.  Running this command will create a new `conda` environment that is provisioned with most of the libraries you need for this summerschool.
```
conda env create -f dsaenvironment.yml
```

**Verify** that the dsa2018 environment was created in your environments:

```sh
conda info --envs
```

**Cleanup** downloaded libraries (remove tarballs, zip files, etc):

```sh
conda clean -tp
```

### Uninstalling

To uninstall the environment:

```sh
conda env remove -n dsa2018
```
