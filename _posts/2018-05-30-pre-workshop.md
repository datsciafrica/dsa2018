### Configure a DSA Environment with [Anaconda](http://conda.pydata.org/docs)

Conda is an open source package management system and environment management system 
for installing multiple versions of software packages and their dependencies and 
switching easily between them. It works on Linux, OS X and Windows, and was created 
for Python programs but can package and distribute any software.

#### Overview

Using Anaconda consists of the following:

1. Install [`miniconda`](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) on your computer
2. Create a new `conda` [environment](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html) using this project
3. Each time you wish to work, activate your `conda` environment

---

#### Installation

**Download** the latest version of `miniconda` that matches your system.

|        | Linux | Mac | Windows |
|--------|-------|-----|---------|
| 64-bit | [64-bit (bash installer)][lin64] | [64-bit (bash installer)][mac64] | [64-bit (exe installer)][win64]
| 32-bit | [32-bit (bash installer)][lin32] |  | [32-bit (exe installer)][win32]

[win64]: https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe
[win32]: https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86.exe
[mac64]: https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
[lin64]: https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
[lin32]: https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86.sh

**Install** [miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) on your machine. Detailed instructions:

- **Linux:** http://conda.pydata.org/docs/install/quick.html#linux-miniconda-install
- **Mac:** http://conda.pydata.org/docs/install/quick.html#os-x-miniconda-install
- **Windows:** http://conda.pydata.org/docs/install/quick.html#windows-miniconda-install

**Setup** the `dsa2018` environment.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/emwebaze/dsa2018materials.git
cd setup
```

**Create** dsa2018.  Running this command will create a new `conda` environment that is provisioned with most of the libraries you need for this summerschool.
```
conda env create -f dsaenvironment.yml
```

**Verify** that the dsa2018 environment was created in your environments:

```sh
conda info --envs
```

**Cleanup** downloaded libraries (remove tarballs, zip files, etc):

```sh
conda clean -tp
```

#### Uninstalling 

To uninstall the environment:

```sh
conda env remove -n dsa2018
```

---

#### Using Anaconda

Now that you have created an environment, in order to use it, you will need to activate the environment. This must be done **each** time you begin a new working session i.e. open a new terminal window. 

**Activate** the `dsa2018` environment:

#### OS X and Linux
```sh
$ source activate dsa2018
```
#### Windows
Depending on shell either:
```sh
$ source activate dsa2018
```
or

```sh
$ activate dsa2018
```

That's it. Now you can fire up your Jupyter Notebook from this terminal and it will load all the necessary libraries.

To exit the environment when you have completed your work session, simply close the terminal window.
