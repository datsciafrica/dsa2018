	  Since 2015, Data Science Africa (DSA) has held an annual summer school and workshop to train participants on machine learning and data science methods and provide an avenue for researchers to present work demonstrating the application of these techniques to problems relevant in the African context.
 </p>

<p align='justify'>For 2018, there will be two events: DSA 2018 Nyeri in Kenya, May 31st to June 8th and DSA 2018 Abuja in Nigeria, 12th to 16th November, representing our goal to consolidate the regional community in East Africa while also expanding to other regions. DSA 2018 Nyeri will focus on training approximately 30 participants who will then be able to serve as trainers in their local contexts. DSA 2018 Nyeri will be a "Training of Trainers" event under the theme "end-to-end data science." </p>
